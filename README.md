**Description**

The Tool is made for the Software [ParsecSoda](http://https://github.com/FlavioFS/ParsecSoda "ParsecSoda") by [FlavioFS](https://github.com/FlavioFS "FlavioFS") which will do a lot of tasks automatically by it self. I basically wrote this Script to Host some Games on [Parsec](https://parsec.app/ "Parsec") and when someone try to close the Game it automatically will restart, so you can use it even if you are away from the Keyboard.
